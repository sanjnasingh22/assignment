1.Java Script with JSX
In React, you write your user interface using JSX. JSX is like a mix of JavaScript and HTML,
and it is  not something web browsers can understand directly.

2.Babel Compilation
When you use Babel with React it takes your JavaScript code with JSX and converts it into plain JavaScript. 
It changes the code into an older version of JavaScript that web browsers can understand.

React takes care of actually showing it on the screen.

ROOT:-The "root" typically refers to an HTML element in our web page where you want to render our React 
application. It's the starting point for our React component tree.In your HTML document, you might have a
<div> element with a specific id like <div id="root"></div> and this is where our React application will
be "rooted" or displayed.It's the entry point where our React components will appear.
